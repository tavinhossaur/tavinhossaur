I am from Brazil, i am a high school student, very interested in the programming area, I do not have much experience yet, 
as I have never worked in the area, but I have a considerable knowledge of the techniques for coding and good practice,
because in my school, we have technical course, and one of them is Systems Development, which i chose for study.
I have good knowledge in C++, HTML, CSS, SQLServer, and I am still learning C#, PHP, JavaScript, Kotlin, and Java

And everything that has a black theme, is enabled for me.
