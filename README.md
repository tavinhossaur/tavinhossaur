I am from Brazil, until the moment this text is here, I am a high school student, very interested in the programming area, unfortunately I do not have much experience yet, 
as I have never worked in the area, but I have a lot of knowledge of the techniques for coding and good practice.
I have good knowledge in C, C ++, HTML, and I am still learning C #, PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and SQL Server. 
I would very much like to start working in the programming area, to gain experience as soon as possible.
